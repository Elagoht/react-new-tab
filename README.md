# React New Tab

I developed this page to freely customize my browsers new tab page. With its brilliant design, I let you lots of settings to tweak your own new tab page.

You can add new pages by just writing name and link. The favicons will be fetched automatically, thanks to <https://icon.horse/>.

Here is the production link: <https://elagoht.github.io/react-new-tab/>

## How To Use?

Install an extension to set custom new tab url.

> For Firefox based browsers:
> <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/>

> For Chromium based browsers:
> <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia>

Then set new tab url to <https://elagoht.github.io/react-new-tab/>.

All done! Have fun with your brand new tab!
